# blog-iac-examples

Code to go along with blog post on different tools/frameworks which can be used for infrastructure as code - using this as a way of forcing myself to try some of these alternative tools out.

Looking to try Terraform, Serverless Framework, aws-cdk, Cloudformation and Serverless Application Model (SAM).

See README files in each subfolder for instructions on running each example.
